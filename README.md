PhotoTool is a very basic image resizing tool.  Nothing special, just the basics - it allows you to load a directory, file, or group of files and run a batch resize on them.  It uses the [ImageProcessor](http://imageprocessor.org/imageprocessor/) library for resizing.  The code is over 10 years old and isn't all that pretty, but it seems to work for me.
